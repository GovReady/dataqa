    """Purpose: To compare efficacy of pemetrexed versus pemetrexed plus carboplatin in pretreated patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients and Methods: Patients with advanced NSCLC, in progression during or after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, were randomly assigned to receive pemetrexed (arm A) or pemetrexed plus carboplatin (arm B). Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). A preplanned pooled analysis of the results of this study with those of the NVALT7 study was carried out to assess the impact of carboplatin added to pemetrexed in terms of overall survival (OS). Results: From July 2007 to October 2009, 239 patients (arm A, n = 120; arm B, n = 119) were enrolled. Median PFS was 3.6 months for arm A versus 3.5 months for arm B (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.36; P = .706). No statistically significant differences in response rate, OS, or toxicity were observed. A total of 479 patients were included in the pooled analysis. OS was not improved by the addition of carboplatin to pemetrexed (HR, 90; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.10; P = .316; P heterogeneity = .495). In the subgroup analyses, the addition of carboplatin to pemetrexed in patients with squamous tumors led to a statistically significant improvement in OS from 5.4 to 9 months (adjusted HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.91; P interaction test = .039). Conclusion: Second-line treatment of advanced NSCLC with pemetrexed plus carboplatin does not improve survival outcomes as compared with single-agent pemetrexed. The benefit observed with carboplatin addition in squamous tumors may warrant further investigation. Â© 2012 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.""",
    "Background: Sunitinib (SU) is an oral multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of VEGFRs, PDGFRs, KIT and other receptors. Preclinical data suggested SU + erlotinib (E), an EGFR TKI approved in recurrent NSCLC, may enhance antitumor activity vs. either agent alone. In early clinical studies SU + E was tolerable. This phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial investigated overall survival (OS) for SU + E vs. E + placebo (P) in patients (PTS) with NSCLC after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy. Methods: Pts (=18 yrs; ECOG PS 0 or 1 and previously treated with 1 to 2 chemotherapy regimens) had recurrent NSCLC for which E was indicated. Pts were randomized (1:1) to SU 37.5 mg/d + E 150 mg/d, or P + E 150 mg/d, stratified by prior bevacizumab use, smoking history, and EGFR expression. The primary endpoint was OS based on 734 events. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), RECIST objective response rate (ORR), safety, and patient-reported outcomes. Results: 960 pts were randomized; baseline characteristics were balanced. Histologies included adenocarcinoma (52.7%) and squamous cell carcinoma (28.1%); median age was 61 yrs (range 30-85); 60.5% were male; and 80.6% had a history of smoking. (Table presented) Conclusion: This phase III trial in recurrent NSCLC did not demonstrate an increase in OS but did demonstrate a significant improvement in PFS for SU + E compared with P + E. The doublet of SU + E was safe and tolerable in this pt population. Further efficacy and safety analyses will be presented at the meeting; additional studies in specific subgroups may be warranted.",
